Makes use of IPFS network
IPFS gives a unique hash(similar to keccak256 or SHA256 nonce hashing) for every piece of content you upload on it and this hash is called CID
Data once uploaded on ipfs can never be deleted or tampered and a given CID will always point to the same data;
IPFS is a peer to peer filesystem that enables users to store, share and access files in a Decentralized network
